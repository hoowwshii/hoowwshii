Hello World!
I'm hoowwshii
Here's some information bout myself!
- I'm currently learning Java(i'm not old), C/C++, Python(just a bit).
- I got no idea what I'm doing though
- I created this GitHub account, so I can see what I did when I was a highschool-er
- I can't fix printer, hack facebook account, and hack wi-fi...
